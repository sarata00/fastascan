# Introduction

**Author: Sara Tolosa Alarcon**

Fastascan is a program that looks for fasta files in a given directory and gives you the following information:

* file directory
* whether the file is a symlink 
* how many sequences it has
* the length of those sequences
* the type of file (nucleotide or protein)

_In case it is a symlink, the number of sequences and length are not shown to avoid possible duplicates._

This small programme was developed as part of a project for the **Introduction to Algorithmics** course of the Master in Bioinformatics for Health Science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
